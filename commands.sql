            variety of mango fruit. The fruit was bred in Florida for commercial use. The most optimal use of this
            variety is considered to be its use in the food and confectionery industry. The fruits are larger than
            average in size, one fruit weighs about 700 grams. Despite the fact that Tommy Atkins fruits are inferior
            in taste to other mango varieties, this variety is valued for its long shelf life and good preservation
            during transportation. Currently, Tommy Atkins is grown in North America, Central America, and many regions
            of South America, including Mexico. You can buy Tommy Atkins mangoes in the FRUIT TIME online store, which
